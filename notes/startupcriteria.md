# How do we define a US later state tech startup

A "startup" in our definition is a company that has never been (1) taken public (2) acquired. We defined "startup" as a phase earlier than either first IPO, or first acquisition. If a company had neither, we assumed that it remains private. 

We also tried to identify companies created through diversting a subsidiary or division of a large corporation. We use for such companies term "spinoff".
